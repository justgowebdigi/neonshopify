Whereas A Wall hanging neon sign comes with a pre-assembled hanging chain used to place the product at the desired location, the length of the chain depends on the size ordered. Follow a few simple steps as given below:Step 1Place your sign flat up against the desired space\/ Wall. To determine the screw hole locations, mark the position of pre-drilled holes with the help of a marker or pencil. Once done, Put aside your neon sign (with the LED facing downward) on a safe cover to avoid any damage.Step 2Now that you are done marking the holes, Use a drill with a ¼” (6mm) drill bit to make the pilot holes accurately on the marked points. For maximum security, you can also use the drywall anchors and tap them into the wall using a hammer.Step 3Unscrew the spacers\/standoffs and place them against the pilot holes. Install the barrel on the wall with combination screws through the barrel into the drywall anchors.Step 4Now Align your sign and thread the studs to the barrels (place the smaller affixing screws through the hollow access by the edges of the sign and secure them across the hollow entry base (Barrel) to the wall).Step 5Once your sign is placed and fixed securely on the surface, Connect your sign to the adapter\/power supply and then into the wall plug-in. If you have opted for the Dimmer option, A connector must be provided to you for the same, link it with the sign "}},"7525003d-9ce5-4379-b4d0-4f555567f816":{"type":"Block","settings":{"question":"Are your LED neon lights battery-operated or do they plug in?","answer":"Neon signs work on a 12V dc power supply operated with standard Plug US Size.

The length of the cord is usually 2m but we can modify the length as per requirement."}},"bbc441fe-efab-4c7d-a1e1-adc23cc8d722":{"type":"Block","settings":{"question":"What if my sign is damaged in transit?","answer":"In the improbable event that your sign has been damaged in transit, we will ensure that a resolution is provided.

The spaces between the letter are sharply hollowed out for a honed and clean appearance.Full acrylic Backboard: The rectangular or complete acrylic backing is always a sturdy and clean choice. This backboard type renders stability to your neon sign and is preferential with the block letters or with free-standing signs."}}},"block_order":["ab89f72a-c55b-4680-aa3a-22e4b611d0f9","09028adb-5ed0-421d-b574-3c21e9875de8","7525003d-9ce5-4379-b4d0-4f555567f816","bbc441fe-efab-4c7d-a1e1-adc23cc8d722","f3c24365-702a-4f42-94be-47252b487c28"],"settings":{"color":"rgba(0,0,0,0)","heading":"FAQs","description":"<p>Frequently Asked Questions<\/p>"}}},"order":["main","1f5d7e64-475b-4f2d-9cb9-621b2dbea776","fafada22-3941-4761-b75f-a29f2c809794","6e4ecb6c-e34f-45a2-9895-af0fdcbc0ea0"]}
